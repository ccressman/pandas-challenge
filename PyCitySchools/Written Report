In this analysis, school operational data (budget, size, type, and name)  was cross-referenced with data of student records to produce simple, baseline statistical analysis. The analysis started by presenting the entirety of the data with a District Summary. The analysis was then refined systematically to look at the data on an individual school level. Metrics within this analysis were also refined to present information on a more granular level (e.g. reading scores by grade). Additionally, bins were created to better present data with pseudo benchmarks. 

Although drawing any manner of causal conclusions from this data regarding school performance  is inappropriate, some clear trends can be noted from the analysis.  Specifically, when comparing the Top 5 Highest-Performing Schools by overall passing rate with the 5 Lowest-Performing Schools by overall passing rate,  a few notable trends emerge. 
	1. All five of the highest-performing schools are Charter schools while all five of the lowest-performing schools are District schools. 
	2. Interestingly, the per student school budget for four of the five highest-performing schools was lower than that of the lowest-performing schools. In fact, the five lowest-performing schools spend over $40 more on average per student than the five highest-performing schools. That represents a higher average spending of 6.5% per student. 
	3. By far, the most significant contributor to the wide gap in overall passing rate was the passing rate in math versus reading. On average, the five lowest-performing schools witnessed a 27.68% lower passing rate in math than the highest-performing schools. 
	4. All five of the lowest-performing schools were categorized as large schools, which were defined as schools with over 2,000 students. Only one out of the five highest-performing schools was categorized as a large school (three schools were classified as medium-sized, and one school was classified as a small-sized school).
